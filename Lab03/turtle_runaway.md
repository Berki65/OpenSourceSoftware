# Turtle Runaway Game: Berkis Turtle Catcher
Project from Berkay Bentetik - 24170078
## Introduction
This week's assignment was a game where a turtle is trying to catch another turtle. 
The game is played by using the arrow keys to move the turtle around the screen. 
The goal is to catch the other turtle. 
The game is over when the turtle catches the other turtle.

## Game Description
I chose a **round based** system where the running turtle becomes **faster** after each round.
The game doesn't have a **time limit**, a time is displayed on the top left of the screen, but it doesn't affect the game. 
The game has no real **ending**, so it's a high score based game.
The round is over when the turtle catches the other turtle.
I added **borders** to the **"map"** so the turtles can't escape the screen.
The game is played by using the **arrow keys** to move the turtle around the screen. 
The game is over when the turtle catches the other turtle or the other turtle escapes.

## Game Mechanics

### I added the following features to the game:
- **Round based game:** The running turtle becomes faster after each round.
- **Borders:** I added **borders** to the **"map"** so the turtles can't escape the screen.
- **Time:** A time is displayed on the screen, but it doesn't affect the game.
- **High score:** The game has no real ending, so it's a high score game.
- **Game over:** The round is over when the turtle catches the other turtle.
- **Controls:** The User can control the turtle with the **multiple** arrow keys (for example, up and right).
- **Speed:** The running turtle becomes **faster** after each round, scaling **infinitely**.
- **Color changing runner:** The running turtle changes **color** after each **round**. When the running turtle reaches, the **red** color stays the same.
- **Smart AI for the runner:** The running turtle has a **smart AI** that tries to escape from the catching turtle.
- **Background Image:** I added a Top-down Pixel Ocean Background Image to the game.
