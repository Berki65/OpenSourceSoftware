# Turtle Runaway Game: Berkis Turtle Catcher
Project from Berkay Bentetik - 24170078
## Introduction
This week's assignment was a game where a turtle is trying to catch another turtle. The game is played by using the arrow keys to move the turtle around the screen. The goal is to catch the other turtle before it escapes. The game is over when the turtle catches the other turtle or the other turtle escapes.

## Game Description
I chose a **round based** game where the running turtle becomes faster after each round.
The game doesn't have a **time limit**, a time is displayed on the screen, but it doesn't affect the game. 
The game has no real ending to it's a high score game.
The game is over when the turtle catches the other turtle.
I added borders to the "map" so the turtles can't escape the screen.
